# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

- BC 2700 - abacus

- Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - binary number system inventor at 1645

- Charles Babbage - father of computer - theoritical concept of first analytical computer 1830.

- Punch card - (1 card for 1 instruction only, 12 rows and 80 columns)

- Ada lovelace - First programmer who wrote the algorithm to calculate Bernaulli's number at 1843.

- Alan turing - father of modern computing and AI, cracked enigma code during WWII.

- RAM, Hard disk, CPU...

### RAM

- 8 bit = 1 byte (2^8-1 = 256 [0-255 any number within this range can be stored into a ram cell] )
- 16 bit ram   (2^16-1 = 256 [0-...] )
- 32 bit ram   (2^32-1 = 256 [0-....] )
- 64 bit ram   (2^64-1 = 256 [0-.....] )

N.B : ram, hard-disk and register set's bit capacity must be same within a computer.

### CPU

- Two parts : 

  1. Processing unit. (conducts arithmatic and logical operations).
  2. Register (contains with register sets with a pointing register).

- Pointing register used to point the RAM cell from where the instruction to execute in processing unit. after processed one cell it will point the next cell or instruction.
- Other registers hold the variable, operator so that processing unit can process. 
- After process one operation the result will be stored to a new empty cell at RAM.
